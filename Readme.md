# Alloy

Alloy is a lightweight and experimental rendering engine built with Swift and Metal. Designed as a toy project for educational purposes, Alloy explores the fundamentals of rendering pipelines, shaders, and GPU programming.

> **Note:** This project is a work-in-progress and primarily serves as a learning tool. Documentation and examples will be provided in the future.

## Features

- **Swift + Metal Integration**
  Harness the power of Swift and Metal for modern rendering techniques.

- **Particle System with Compute Shaders**  
  Includes a particle system built on top of Metal compute shaders.

- **Lightweight Design**
  Simple architecture focused on clarity and educational value.

## Purpose

Alloy is not intended to compete with production-ready engines. Instead, it serves as a playground for experimenting with rendering techniques and GPU programming concepts. If you're curious about how rendering engines work or want to learn by tinkering, Alloy might be a good starting point.

## Future Development

- Detailed **documentation** explaining the engine's architecture and concepts.
- Code **examples** showcasing Alloy's features and potential use cases.
- Possible **refinements** based on feedback and further exploration.
